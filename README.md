# Physical AI Textbook Engine

An autonomous AI-driven system that builds, maintains, and powers the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook with a fully integrated RAG search engine and agentic development workflow.

The system uses **Codex automation**, **Docusaurus**, **FastAPI**, **Qdrant**, **Neon Postgres**, and **OpenAI models** to generate chapters, refine content, produce history logs, and execute tasks sequentially like an intelligent engineering agent.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Physical AI Textbook Engine** is designed to create a complete robotics and embodied-intelligence learning platform.  
The engine writes chapters, organizes modules, generates documentation, builds the frontend, constructs the backend, and integrates a chatbot — all based on a single master file (`info.md`).

### Key Features

- 📘 **Docusaurus-based robotics textbook**
- 🤖 **Autonomous agentic workflow (spec → plan → implement → refine)**
- 🔍 **RAG search engine with selected-text querying**
- 🧩 **Modular course chapters: ROS2, Gazebo/Unity, Isaac, VLA**
- 🌐 **Deployment-ready backend (FastAPI + Qdrant + Neon)**
- 💬 **Embedded chatbot inside the textbook**
- 🌙 **Optional Urdu translation & personalized content**
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication (Clerk/Custom JWT)**
- 📝 **Automatic task history generation**

## 🧠 Agentic Workflow (How the System Works)

This project is powered by a fully autonomous Codex workflow:

1. You provide **info.md**
2. Codex generates `instructions.md`
3. Codex generates sorted, numbered `tasks.md`
4. You say:
   ```
   Proceed with Task 1
   ```
5. Codex:
   - Executes the task
   - Modifies files
   - Creates specs
   - Builds UI or backend
   - Generates a history file
   - Marks task complete
6. You say:
   ```
   Proceed with Task 2
   ```
7. Codex repeats the cycle until the entire project is complete.

This creates a **living, self-evolving AI textbook engine**.

## 📜 Autonomous History System

After every completed task, Codex:

- Creates a new history file
- Auto-generates metadata
- Writes prompt + summary
- Stores it under a feature folder

History format is fully **AI-defined and self-consistent**.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Project

- Build a complete robotics course with AI
- Demonstrate autonomous engineering using Codex
- Provide students with a high-quality RAG chatbot
- Create AI-generated educational content
- Showcase next-generation agentic workflows

---

## ▶️ Demo Video (Required by Hackathon)

A short (≤ 90 sec) video will demonstrate:

- The textbook
- RAG answering system
- Chatbot flow
- Codex performing tasks autonomously
- Deployed frontend and backend

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

This project is primarily agent-driven.  
You only need to:

### 1. Add `info.md`

The master specification file.

### 2. Tell Codex:

```
Read info.md and generate instructions.md
```

### 3. Then:

```
Generate tasks.md
```

### 4. Then execute step-by-step:

```
Proceed with Task 1
Proceed with Task 2
...
```

Codex does the rest.

## 💡 Why This Project Is Unique

- It is **not** a static website.
- It is **not** a manually-built RAG system.

It is a **self-building, self-organizing AI engine** that creates an entire textbook,  
writes its own documentation, executes its own plans, and logs its own progress.

A true demonstration of **agentic AI engineering**.
